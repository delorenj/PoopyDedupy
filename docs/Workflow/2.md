Cursor Composer (o1-preview)

# Goal

I had an idea that I could formalize my development process by creating a set of steps that capture my thought process as I work from "thought in my head" to "finished product". I originally wanted to record the process, but 20 projects in and I realized with a day job and children that "recording" the process was not going to work. So, I'm trying the next best thing - only I realizing now that this is going to be quite useful for others.

# Prompt
```text
Using Obsidian Templater markdown, generate a basic layout for each 'Step' of my Workflow Step-by-Step guide. At the very least, i'd like to have some common properties indicating Tool or Service (Cursor Composer, Trello, Perplexity, Obsidian, Terminal, etc), Step Goal (What i aim to accomplish in this chunk of work), Goal Source (me, output from a previous step, etc), Context (what project resources, notes, etc are needed for optimal performance of this step), etc.  If you think of anything im leaving out, you may add it!

```

# Context
- [PRD.md](./PRD.md)

# Output
```markdown
Certainly! I'll create a basic layout for each 'Step' of your Workflow Step-by-Step guide using Obsidian Templater markdown. This template will include the properties you've mentioned and a few additional ones that might be useful. Here's the template:

[template, step.md](./template, step.md)

his template includes the following sections:
YAML frontmatter with key properties for easy reference and potential future automation.
A header with the step number and goal.
Sections for Tool/Service, Goal, Goal Source, and Context as requested.
Additional sections for Input and Output to clearly define what's needed and what's produced in each step.
A Process section where you can list the specific actions to take in this step.
A Next Step section to link the workflow together.
A Notes section for any additional information or observations.
A Time Spent section to track estimated and actual time, which can be useful for future planning and optimization.
To use this template:
Save it as a template in your Obsidian vault (e.g., as "Workflow Step Template").
When creating a new step, use the Templater plugin to insert this template.
The <% tp.system.prompt() %> tags will prompt you to fill in the information for each field when you create a new note from this template.
This structure aligns well with the requirements outlined in your PRD, particularly in terms of user interaction, logging, and maintainability. It provides a clear, consistent format for documenting each step of your workflow, which will be helpful when using tools like PooperDeduper to manage your Obsidian vault.
